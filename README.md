A tool for visualizing your complete, consolidated, collected Google [Location History](https://google.com/locationhistory).

It works directly in your web browser &ndash; no software to download, no packages to install. 

*location-history-visualizer* takes raw Google Takeout output and produces a heatmap of all of your location data over time, overlaid on an interactive map.

## Packages used
* [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), for rendering the interactive map
* [filestream](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/filestream), for dealing with gigantic Google Takeout files
* [oboe.js](http://oboejs.com), for processing said gigantic files
* [browserify](http://browserify.org/), for helping filestream  work properly in the browser
